# NodeFarm
I created NodeJS app for learning purposes.  
Here I'm using the core libraries like http, url, fs and slugify.
I have routes depending of which project you click, then I overwrite the html templates with specific information for that product using the query.  
I'm using slugify to make slugs for all my products.  
The app is hosted live on vercel, you can check it here: https://node-farm-gray.vercel.app/
